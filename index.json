Here, we revisit the correlation relating the instantaneous flux, F, and the photon index below the spectral break, α, in individual emission pulses, by studying the 38 most prominent pulses in the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor GRB catalogue. First, we search for signatures of the bias in the determination of α due to the limited spectral coverage (window effect) expected in the synchrotron case. The absence of such a characteristic signature argues against the simplest synchrotron models. We instead find that the observed correlation between F and α can, in general, be described by the relation F(t) ∝ e^{k α (t)}, for which the median k = 3. We suggest that this correlation is a manifestation of subphotospheric heating in a flow with a varying entropy. Around the peak of the light curve, a large entropy causes the photosphere to approach the saturation radius, leading to an intense emission with a narrow spectrum. As the entropy decreases the photosphere secedes from the saturation radius, and weaker emission with a broader spectrum is expected. This simple scenario naturally leads to a correlated variation of the intensity and spectral shape, covering the observed range.","tags":["Gamma-Ray Bursts","Bayesian Statistics"],"title":"On the α-Intensity Correlation in GRBs Subphotospheric Heating With Varying Entropy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lin, E.-T.","Yu, H.-F.","Kong, A.

We also obtained the parameter uncertainties directly from their posterior probability distributions. We are able to confirm that the power-law photon index has remained constant of Γ ∼ 1.6 throughout the entire year-long observing period, except for the first dataset observed at t = 8.9 d when Γ = 1.04 ± 0.44 is marginally harder. We also found that the unabsorbed X-ray flux peaked at t ∼ 155 d, temporally consistent with the X-ray flare model suggested recently by Piro et al. (2019). The X-ray flux has been fading since ∼160 days after the merger and has returned to the level as first discovered after one year.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has the largest field of view for detecting GRBs as it views the entire unocculted sky, but as a non-imaging instrument it relies on the relative count rates observed in each of its 14 detectors to localize transients. Improving its ability to accurately locate GRBs and other transients is vital to the paradigm of multimessenger astronomy, including the electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave signals. Here we present the BAyesian Location Reconstruction Of GRBs (BALROG) method for localizing and characterizing GBM transients. Our approach eliminates the systematics of previous approaches by simultaneously fitting for the location and spectrum of a source. It also correctly incorporates the uncertainties in the location of a transient into the spectral parameters and produces reliable positional uncertainties for both well-localized sources and those for which the GBM data cannot effectively constrain the position. While computationally expensive, BALROG can be implemented to enable quick follow-up of all GBM transient signals. Also, we identify possible response problems that require attention and caution when using standard, public GBM detector response matrices. Finally, we examine the effects of including the uncertainty in location on the spectral parameters of GRB 080916C. We find that spectral parameters change and no extra components are required when these effects are included in contrast to when we use a fixed location. This finding has the potential to alter both the GRB spectral catalogues and the reported spectral composition of some well-known GRBs.","tags":["Gamma-Ray Bursts","Bayesian Statistics"],"title":"Awakening the BALROG: BAyesian Location Reconstruction of GRBs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu, H.-F.","Hui, C.

We aim to obtain a measure of the curvature of time-resolved spectra that can be compared directly to theory. This tests the ability of models such as synchrotron emission to explain the peaks or breaks of GBM prompt emission spectra. We take the burst sample from the official Fermi GBM GRB time-resolved spectral catalog. We re-fit all spectra with a measured peak or break energy in the catalog best-fit models in various energy ranges, which cover the curvature around the spectral peak or break, resulting in a total of 1113 spectra being analyzed. We compute the sharpness angles under the peak or break of the triangle constructed under the model fit curves and compare them to the values obtained from various representative emission models: blackbody, single-electron synchrotron, synchrotron emission from a Maxwellian or power-law electron distribution. We find that 35% of the time-resolved spectra are inconsistent with the single-electron synchrotron function, and 91% are inconsistent with the Maxwellian synchrotron function. The single temperature, single emission time, and location blackbody function is found to be sharper than all the spectra. No general evolutionary trend of the sharpness angle is observed, neither per burst nor for the whole population. It is found that the limiting case, a single temperature Maxwellian synchrotron function, can only contribute up to % of the peak flux. Our results show that even the sharpest but non-realistic case, the single-electron synchrotron function, cannot explain a large fraction of the observed GRB prompt spectra. Because any combination of physically possible synchrotron spectra added together will always further broaden the spectrum, emission mechanisms other than optically thin synchrotron radiation are likely required in a full explanation of the spectral peaks or breaks of the GRB prompt emission phase.","tags":["Gamma-Ray Bursts"],"title":"The Sharpness of Gamma Ray Burst Prompt Emission Spectra","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Burgess, J.

Generally, the empirical Band function is fit to the observed gamma-ray data and the fit parameters that are used to infer which radiative mechanisms are at work in GRB outflows. In particular, the distribution of the Band function's low-energy power-law index, α, has led to the so-called synchrotron `line-of-death' (LOD) which is a statement that the distribution cannot be explained by the simplest of synchrotron models alone. As an alternatively fitting model, a combination of a blackbody in addition to the Band function is used, which in many cases provide a better or equally good fit. It has been suggested that such fits would be able to alleviate the LOD problem for synchrotron emission in GRBs. However, these conclusions rely on the Band function's ability to fit a synchrotron spectrum within the observed energy band. In order to investigate if this is the case, we simulate synchrotron and synchrotron+blackbody spectra and fold them through the instrumental response of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We then perform a standard data analysis by fitting the simulated data with both Band and Band+blackbody models. We find two important results: the synchrotron LOD is actually more severe than the original predictions: αLOD ˜ -0.8. Moreover, we find that intrinsic synchrotron+blackbody emission is insufficient to account for the entire observed α distribution. This implies that some other emission mechanism(s) are required to explain a large fraction of observed GRBs.","tags":["Gamma-Ray Bursts"],"title":"Taking the Band Function Too Far: a Tale of Two α's","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu, H.-F.","Greiner, J.","van Eerten, H.","et al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420126005,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420126005,"objectID":"f85aea54fdccc5207392efe0a0602f06","permalink":"https://hfdavidyu.github.io/publication/synchrotron-cooling-in-energetic-gamma-ray-bursts-observed-by-the-fermi-gbm/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T23:26:45+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/synchrotron-cooling-in-energetic-gamma-ray-bursts-observed-by-the-fermi-gbm/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the time-resolved spectral properties of energetic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with good high-energy photon statistics observed by the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope.
