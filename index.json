I will give an 1-hour overview on the difference between Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods, followed by a 2-hour hands-on session on analysing some simulated data. We will learn how to properly fit a line to data points. We will get to know that we have probably mis-understood some of the statistical concepts. No more reduced-Chi-squared, no more F-test, because a single Bayes Theorem rules them all.\nParticipants should bring their own laptop and get the following installed before coming to the hands-on session.\nPython (better version 2.7.xx)\nPyMC3 (the main Bayesian tool we are using)\nJupyter Notebook (iPython interactive interface used together with your web browser)\nPip (tool to download the following Python packages)\n numpy (basic computation) scipy (scientific computation) matplotlib (for plotting) seaborn (for nice contour/corner plots)  You can also choose to install Anaconda for Jupyter following the instruction in the previous Python Training Workshop 2018.\nDetailed instruction can be found therein in the links.
